# Installation

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/numbat.svg)](https://repology.org/project/numbat/versions)

## Linux

### Ubuntu

*... and other Debian-based Linux distributions.*

Download the latest `.deb` package from [the release page](https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat/releases)
and install it via `dpkg`. For example:

``` bash
curl -LO https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat/releases/download/v1.14.0/numbat_1.14.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i numbat_1.14.0_amd64.deb
```

Alternatively, if you want automatic updates, you can use a community-maintained [Numbat PPA](https://launchpad.net/~apandada1/+archive/ubuntu/numbat). The PPA only hosts packages for the `amd64`/`x86_64` architecture.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:apandada1/numbat
sudo apt update
sudo apt install numbat
```

### Arch Linux

In Arch Linux and Arch based distributions, you can install the
[prebuilt package of Numbat](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/numbat-bin) from the AUR for the `x86_64` architecture:

``` bash
yay -S numbat-bin
```

You can also install the [numbat](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/numbat)
AUR package, which will download the source and compile it. It works on all architectures.

``` bash
yay -S numbat
```

### Void Linux

You can install the `numbat` package using

``` bash
sudo xbps-install -S numbat
```

### Chimera Linux

Chimera Linux has a `numbat` package in its `contrib` repo. [Enable it if you
haven't already](https://chimera-linux.org/docs/apk#repositories), then install
`numbat`:

``` bash
doas apk add numbat
```

## Android
There are two options, the first is to install directly, and the second is to install inside a proot running a regular GNU/Linux Distro.

### First method (direct installation in termux):

This method consumes less space, but there is no way to auto-update.

First, install [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/).
Install wget
```
sudo apt install wget tar
```
Then, download and extract the compatible musl version of Numbat.
```
export LATEST_VER=1.14.0
wget https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat/releases/download/v$LATEST_VER/numbat-v$LATEST_VER-arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf.tar.gz
tar -xzvf numbat-v$LATEST_VER-arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf.tar.gz
```
Now add numbat to path using a symlink
```
ln -s /data/data/com.termux/files/home/numbat-v$LATEST_VER-arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf/numbat /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/numbat
```

### Second method (installation inside a proot distro):

Install a Proot distro like [TermuxArch](https://termuxarch.github.io/TermuxArch/), and install numbat inside Arch Linux using the method [described above](https://numbat.dev/doc/cli-installation.html#arch-linux). This method consumes more space, but you don't have to worry about updating Numbat or copy paste long commands from the internet.

## macOS

### Homebrew

You can install Numbat with Homebrew:

``` bash
brew install numbat

```

## Windows

### Scoop

You can install the [numbat](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=numbat) package using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

``` bash
scoop install main/numbat
```

## NixOS

*... or any distribution where Nix is installed.*

Install [numbat](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=numbat&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=numbat) to your profile:

``` bash
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.numbat
```
Or add it to your NixOS Configuration:

``` nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  pkgs.numbat
];
```

## From pre-built binaries

Download the latest release for your system from [this page](https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat/releases). Unpack
the archive and place the `numbat`/`numbat.exe` binary in a folder that is on your `PATH`.

Note that the `modules` folder that is included in the archives is not strictly required to run Numbat. It serves more
as a reference for interested users. However, if you want to get the best possible experience or if you are
a package maintainer, please follow [these guidelines](./cli-installation.md#guidelines-for-package-maintainers).

## From source

Clone the Git repository, and build Numbat with `cargo`:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat
cd numbat/
cargo install -f --path numbat-cli
```

Or install the latest release using

``` bash
cargo install numbat-cli
```

## Guidelines for package maintainers

Thank you for packaging Numbat! This section contains instructions that are not strictly necessary
to create a Numbat package, but provide users with the best-possible experience on your target platform.

Numbat has a [standard library](./prelude.md) that is written in Numbat itself. The sources for this
so called "prelude" are available in the [`numbat/modules`](https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat/tree/master/numbat/modules) folder.
We also include this `modules` folder in the pre-built [GitHub releases](https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat/releases).
Installing this folder as part of the package installation is not necessary for Numbat to work, as the prelude is also
stored inside the `numbat` binary. But ideally, this folder should be made available for users. There are three reasons for this:

- Users might want to look at the code in the standard library to get a better understanding of the language itself.
- For some error messages, Numbat refers to locations in the source code. For example, if you type `let meter = 2`, the compiler
  will let you know that this identifier is already in use, and has been previously defined at a certain location inside the
  standard library. If the corresponding module is available as a file on the users system, they will see the proper path and
  can read the corresponding file.
- Users might want to make changes to the prelude. Ideally, this should be done via a [user module folder](./cli-customization.md),
  but the system-wide folder can serve as a template.

In order for this to work, the `modules` folder should ideally be placed in the [standard location for the
target operating system](./cli-customization.md). If this is not possible, package maintainers can customize
numbat during compilation by setting the environment variable `NUMBAT_SYSTEM_MODULE_PATH` to the final locatiom.
If this variable is set during compilation, the specified path will be compiled into the `numbat` binary.

In order to test that everything is working as intended, you can open `numbat` and type `let meter = 2`. The
path in the error message should point to the specified location (and *not* to `<builtin>/â€¦`).

If your OS uses `.desktop` files, you should probably also install:

- `assets/numbat.desktop` (typically to `/usr/share/applications`)
- `assets/numbat.svg` (typically to `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps`)
- `assets/numbat-*x*.png` (typically to e.g. `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/32x32/apps`, depending on each icon's size)

This allows users to e.g. pin Numbat to GNOME's Dash.
