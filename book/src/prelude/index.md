Numbat comes with a special module called `prelude` that is always loaded on
startup. This module
is split into multiple submodules and sets up a useful default environment with
mathematical functions, constants but also dimension definitions, unit
definitions and physical constants.

!!! info

    Use the `--no-prelude` command line option to start Numbat without loading
    the prelude module.

You can find the full source code of the standard library
[on GitHub](https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat/tree/main/numbat/modules).

This chapter includes a reference to the prelude module.
