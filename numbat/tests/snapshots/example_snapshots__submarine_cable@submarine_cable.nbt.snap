Router delay: 2 router * 0.4 ms = 0.8 ms
Transponder delay: 2 transponder * 0.05 ms = 0.1 ms
Amplifier delay: 15 amplifier * 0.005 ms = 0.075 ms

Estimated One-Way Latency: 6.14276 ms
Estimated Round-Trip Time (RTT): 12.2855 ms

Summary
===============================================================================
For a 1055 km submarine cable, the estimated one-way latency is ~6.14 ms,
resulting in a round-trip time (RTT) of ~12.29 ms.

This is based on the speed of light in an optical fiber with an average
refractive index of 1.47, which is 2.04151e+8 m/s. This speed is approximately 
-31.90 % of the speed of light in a vacuum.

Assuming symmetrical latency, the round-trip time (RTT) is a sum of the
propagation delay (~5.16776 ms) and the cumulative processing delays from
network appliances (~0.975 ms), multiply by 2.
